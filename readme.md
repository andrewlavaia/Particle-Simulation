## Summary

A particle simulation program that graphically depicts different types of particles colliding with one another. 

The idea for this program was inspired by the Princeton Algorithms course by Robert Sedgewick. A framework for an event driven particle simulation (written in Java) is also referenced in Sedgewick's textbook Algorithms (Fourth Edition). 

This program is a full-fledged python implementation of Sedgewick's framework along with the following enhancements and features: 
- GUI with main menu 
- multiprocessing support
- collidable line segments that can be placed at any angle
- particles that can be customized by size, shape, and color
- simulation parameters that can be adjusted while the program is running
- loadable preconfigured scenarios 
- unit tests to ensure calculations are accurate
- ability to completely pause the simulation at any time

## Instructions

1) install Python 3.6 or later
2) install PyYAML -> `pip install PyYAML`
3) run `main.py` from the console -> `python main.py`
